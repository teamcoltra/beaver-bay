==========

The Beaver Bay is a torrent site which users public trackers. 

To Do:
* Design A Database (TAK):
 * User (username,password,salt,emailaddress,dateregistered)
 * Torrents (id(int auto),featured (bool),nfo(varchar),hash,seeders(int),leechers(int), rating(int), tags, more?)
 * Comments (id (int auto), stickied(bool), comment, commenterid)
* Design The Site (COLTRA):
 * Bootstrap CSS
 * Home Page, Torrent Page, Search Results, Category Page, Category List

More probably to come but we can work on that and see where that takes us.
